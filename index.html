              <p>Nepal (English: /nɪˈpɔːl/;[14] Nepali: नेपाल [nepal]), officially the Federal Democratic Republic of
                Nepal (Nepali: सङ्घीय लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्र नेपाल), is a landlocked country in South Asia. It is mainly
                situated in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It borders the Tibet
                Autonomous Region of China to the north, and India in the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly
                separated from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal
                has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's
                ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's
                capital and the largest city. Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-cultural
                state, with Nepali as the official language.

                The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent, the era in
                ancient Nepal when Hinduism was founded, the predominant religion of the country. In the middle of the
                first millennium BC, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal.
                Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet. The centrally located Kathmandu
                Valley is intertwined with the culture of Indo-Aryans, and was the seat of the prosperous Newar
                confederacy known as Nepal Mandala. The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was dominated by the
                valley's traders. The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art and architecture. By the
                18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal. The Shah dynasty established the
                Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an alliance with the British Empire, under its Rana dynasty of
                premiers. The country was never colonised but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and
                British India. Parliamentary democracy was introduced in 1951 but was twice suspended by Nepalese
                monarchs, in 1960 and 2005. The Nepalese Civil War in the 1990s and early 2000s resulted in the
                establishment of a secular republic in 2008, ending the world's last Hindu monarchy.</p>

              <p>India, officially the Republic of India (ISO: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[25] is a country in South Asia. It is
                the seventh-largest country by area, the most populous country as of 1 May 2023, and the most populous
                democracy in the world.[26][27] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the
                southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[j]
                China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean,
                India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime
                border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.

                Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[28][29][30]
                Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region
                highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[31] Settled life emerged on the
                subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into
                the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[32] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit,
                an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[33][34] Its evidence today is
                found in the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by a resolutely vigilant oral tradition, the Rigveda
                records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[35] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the
                northern and western regions.[36] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within
                Hinduism,[37] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[38]
                Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges
                Basin.[39] Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[40] but also marked by the
                declining status of women,[41] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of
                belief.[k][42] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious
                cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[43]

                In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on
                India's southern and western coasts.[44] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's
                northern plains,[45] eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the
                cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[46] In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a
                long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[47] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting
                institutionalised religion.[48] The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative
                peace,[49] leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[l][50] Gradually expanding rule of the British
                East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its
                sovereignty.[51] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted
                slowly,[52][53] but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and the public
                life took root.[54] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for
                nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[55][56] In 1947 the British
                Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[57][58][59][60] a Hindu-majority Dominion
                of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented
                migration.[61]

                India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is
                a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951
                to almost 1.4 billion in 2022.[62] During the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from
                US$64 annually to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively
                destitute country in 1951,[63] India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information
                technology services, with an expanding middle class.[64] It has a space programme which includes several
                planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an
                increasing role in global culture.[65] India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at
                the cost of increasing economic inequality.[66] India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in
                military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved
                since the mid-20th century.[67] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality,
                child malnutrition,[68] and rising levels of air pollution.[69] India's land is megadiverse, with four
                biodiversity hotspots.[70] Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area.[71] India's wildlife, which has
                traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture,[72] is supported among these forests, and
                elsewhere, in protected habitats.

              <p>Pakistan (Urdu: پَاکِسْتَان [ˈpaːkɪstaːn]),[d] officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (اِسْلامی
                جَمْہُورِیَہ پَاکِسْتَان), is a country in South Asia. It is the world's fifth-most populous country,
                with a population of over 249 million people, and has the world's second-largest Muslim population, just
                behind Indonesia.[16] Islamabad is the nation's capital, while Karachi is its largest city and financial
                centre, followed by Lahore and Faisalabad. Pakistan is the 33rd-largest country in the world by area and
                the second-largest in South Asia, spanning 881,913 square kilometres (340,509 square miles). It has a
                1,046-kilometre (650-mile) coastline along the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman in the south, and is
                bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest, and China to the
                northeast. It is separated narrowly from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor in the north, and
                also shares a maritime border with Oman.

                Pakistan is the site of several ancient cultures, including the 8,500-year-old Neolithic site of
                Mehrgarh in Balochistan,[17] the Indus Valley civilisation of the Bronze Age,[18][19] and the ancient
                Gandhara civilisation.[20] The regions that comprise the modern state of Pakistan were the realm of
                multiple empires and dynasties, including the Achaemenid, the Maurya, the Kushan, the Gupta;[21] the
                Umayyad Caliphate in its southern regions, the Samma, the Hindu Shahis, the Shah Miris, the Ghaznavids,
                the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughals,[22] and most recently, the British Raj from 1858 to 1947.

                Spurred by the Pakistan Movement, which sought a homeland for the Muslims of British India, and election
                victories in 1946 by the All-India Muslim League, Pakistan gained independence in 1947 after the
                Partition of the British Indian Empire, which awarded separate statehood to its Muslim-majority regions
                and was accompanied by an unparalleled mass migration and loss of life.[23] Initially a Dominion of the
                British Commonwealth, Pakistan officially drafted its constitution in 1956, and emerged as a declared
                Islamic republic. In 1971, the exclave of East Pakistan seceded as the new country of Bangladesh after a
                nine-month-long civil war. In the following four decades, Pakistan has been ruled by governments whose
                descriptions, although complex, commonly alternated between civilian and military, democratic and
                authoritarian, relatively secular and Islamist.[24] Pakistan elected a civilian government in 2008, and
                in 2010 adopted a parliamentary system with periodic elections.[25]

                Pakistan is a middle power nation,[26][27][28][29][30][31] and has the world's sixth-largest standing
                armed forces. It is a declared nuclear-weapons state, and is ranked amongst the emerging and
                growth-leading economies,[32] with a large and rapidly-growing middle class.[33] Pakistan's political
                history since independence has been characterised by periods of significant economic and military growth
                as well as those of political and economic instability. It is an ethnically and linguistically diverse
                country, with similarly diverse geography and wildlife. The country continues to face challenges,
                including poverty, illiteracy, corruption and terrorism.[34] Pakistan is a member of the United Nations,
                the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Commonwealth of
                Nations, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, and the Islamic Military
                Counter-Terrorism Coalition, and is designated as a major non-NATO ally by the United States.</p>

              <p>The United States of America (U.S.A. or USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US) or
                America, is a country primarily located in North America. It consists of 50 states, a federal district,
                five major unincorporated territories, nine Minor Outlying Islands,[i] and 326 Indian reservations. The
                United States is the world's third-largest country by both land and total area.[c] It shares land
                borders with Canada to its north and with Mexico to its south and has maritime borders with the Bahamas,
                Cuba, Russia, and other nations.[j] With a population of over 333 million,[k] it is the most populous
                country in the Americas and the third most populous in the world. The national capital of the United
                States is Washington, D.C., and its most populous city and principal financial center is New York City.

                Indigenous peoples have inhabited the Americas for thousands of years. Beginning in 1607, British
                colonization led to the establishment of the Thirteen Colonies in what is now the Eastern United States.
                They quarreled with the British Crown over taxation and political representation, leading to the
                American Revolution and proceeding Revolutionary War. The United States declared independence on July 4,
                1776, becoming the first nation-state founded on Enlightenment principles of unalienable natural rights,
                consent of the governed, and liberal democracy. During the nineteenth century, the United States
                political philosophy was influenced by the concept of manifest destiny, as the country expanded across
                the continent in a number of wars, land purchases, and treaties, eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean
                by the middle of the century. Sectional division surrounding slavery in the Southern United States led
                to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union
                during the American Civil War (1861–1865). With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was
                abolished nationally by the Thirteenth Amendment.

                By 1900, the United States had established itself as a world power, becoming the world's largest
                economy. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the U.S. entered World War II on the Allied side.
                The aftermath of the war left the United States and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and
                led to the Cold War. During the Cold War, both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance
                but avoided direct military conflict. They also competed in the Space Race, which culminated in the 1969
                landing of Apollo 11, making the U.S. the first and only nation to ever land humans on the Moon. With
                the Soviet Union's collapse and the subsequent end of the Cold War in 1991, the United States emerged as
                the world's sole superpower.</p>
